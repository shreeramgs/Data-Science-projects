Statistical Data Mining: Supervised Learning Methods
This folder contains implementations of several supervised learning methods in R for the Statistical Data Mining.
Various visualizations techniques also have been used such as ggplot.
Datasets involved:
**cereal.csv** : To make analysis on various nutritional values and find correlations between them and perform Classification and Regression Training. 
**Boston Housing dataset**: used for predicts whether a property is located in a high or low-value area based on its characteristics using logistic regression model and random forest models.
**Weekly Dataset**
**diabeties Dataset**
**pendigits Dataset**
**spam Dataset**
