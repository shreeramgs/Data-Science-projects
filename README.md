# Guide for Data Science Projects in 2023
## How to start?

**Find/Define a problem statement**:
The problem statement is a critical first step in any data science project, providing a clear definition of the problem to be solved and guiding the development of research questions and a hypotheses to reach a well-defined solution.

**How to find the scope of the problem, and where to begin?**
One approach I personally use to start and solve any case scenario is use the below method, and structure a solution accordingly.

## Statistical-Data-Mining

Statistical Data Mining: Supervised Learning Methods
This folder contains implementations of several supervised learning methods in R for the Statistical Data Mining.
Various visualizations techniques also have been used such as ggplot.
Datasets involved:
**cereal.csv** : To make analysis on various nutritional values and find correlations between them and perform Classification and Regression Training. 
**Boston Housing dataset**: used for predicts whether a property is located in a high or low-value area based on its characteristics using logistic regression model and random forest models.
**Weekly Dataset**
**diabeties Dataset**
**pendigits Dataset**
**spam Dataset**
