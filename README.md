# Guide for Data Science Projects in 2023
## How to start?

**Find/Define a problem statement**:
The problem statement is a critical first step in any data science project, providing a clear definition of the problem to be solved and guiding the development of research questions and hypotheses to reach a well-defined solution.

**How to find the scope of the problem, and where to begin? **
One approach I personally use to start and solve any case scenario is to use the below method and structure a solution accordingly.
